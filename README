GRAPH-GTK
=========

Graph-gtk is a library which allows easy integration of a graphical node editor in Gtk+ applications. This node editor is a custom widget which is extensible, customizable, and usable in virtually any application where the user should be able to interact with a graph via a graphical interface. Currently graph-gtk expects underlying graphics to follow an input->output paradigm (i.e. directed graphs), however plans for the future include generalizing the structure to allow for any sort of graph.
